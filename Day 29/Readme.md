## How to make a ZSL text classifier using Hugging Face ðŸ¤— and Streamlit ðŸŽˆ
### About the Task ---

Create a zero-shot learning text classifier using Hugging Face's API inference and Distilbart!

We will have the mighty power to classify keyphrases on-the-fly, fast, and without pre ML training! ðŸ¤¯

Create classifying labels, paste your keyphrases, and you're off!

*I can set these labels anything, e.g.:*

- `Positive, Negative` and `Neutral` for sentiment analysis
- `Angry, Happy, Emotional` for emotion analysis
- `Navigational, Transactional, Informational` for intent classification purposes
Any  product range (bags, shoes, boots etc.)
We decide! ðŸ’ª
